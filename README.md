# python-playground

Some coding challenges implemented in Python programming language. See the docstring of the functions in `main.py`.

Unit tests are also added. They are based on Pytest. Run the following command to execute them.

```
pytest -v
```

Before everything else you should run the following command to initiate your Python virtualenv, 
if your IDE didn't do so.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
